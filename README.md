# Ronald Skinner's Portfolio

> This is my professional portfolio built using Vercel's #NextJS framework, pulling some data (skills/projects) from Storyblok and rendering the output using this fantastic feature Nextjs offers us, incremental static regeneration (ISR). I deployed it on Netlify which handles Nextjs apps seamlessly with its brand-new runtime. Last but not least, I'm protecting my contact form with the new Cloudflare's #Turnstile service, a nicely integrated smart CAPTCHA alternative.


## Built With

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- Storyblok
- Testing Library
- Redux / Redux Toolkit
- Firebase SDK
- Firespot (My own open-source npm package)
- Formik

## Live Demo
